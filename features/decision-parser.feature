Feature: Parse architecture decisions
  Tonic decisions describe intended architecture without depending on an
  implementation language or framework.

  Scenario: Parse a decision with drivers, accepted costs, and history
    Given the decision source:
      """
      Decision PAY-003 "Reliable confirmation delivery"

      Driven by requirement ORDER-006
      Driven by decision OPS-002

      Choose durable storage of pending confirmations

      Because accepted orders must survive delivery outages

      Accept possible duplicate delivery
      Accept additional operational storage

      Supersedes PAY-001
      """
    When the decision is parsed
    Then the parsed decision is:
      | id         | PAY-003                                           |
      | title      | Reliable confirmation delivery                    |
      | choice     | durable storage of pending confirmations          |
      | rationale  | accepted orders must survive delivery outages     |
      | supersedes | PAY-001                                           |
    And the decision starts at line 1 column 1
    And the choice starts at line 6 column 1
    And its drivers are:
      | kind        | id        |
      | requirement | ORDER-006 |
      | decision    | OPS-002   |
    And its accepted costs are:
      | possible duplicate delivery     |
      | additional operational storage  |

  Scenario: Parse a decision without optional costs or history
    Given the decision source:
      """
      Decision DATA-004 "Keep customer records regionally isolated"

      """
    When the decision is parsed
    Then the decision has no accepted costs
